# Laravel Forge Recipes

Just a small collection of recipes for repetitive tasks after provisioning a server/app under Laravel Forge.
To use any of these, it is recommended to use the contents of the shell script as opposed to the curl snippets.
Copy the code and paste under ```New Recipe``` in Forge.

&nbsp;

#### System - Stop and Disable Services On Boot (MySQL  / Postgres / Beanstalkd / Redis / Memcached)
Will disable and stop services installed by Forge on provisioning but leave nginx alone. Useful if your app already connects to external resources like AWS.

Executes: [system-stop-and-disable-services-on-boot.sh](system-stop-and-disable-services-on-boot.sh)
```bash
curl -sS "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuanDMeGon/laravel-forge-recipes/master/system-stop-and-disable-services-on-boot.sh" | sh
```

&nbsp;

#### Nginx - Set Real visitor ip address from Cloudflare (Enable)
Will create a conf file ```/etc/nginx/conf.d/cloudflare-set-real-ip.conf```
with cloudflare's ip addresses and use the ```CF-Connecting-IP``` header to set the real ip address then restarts nginx.
If cloudflare updates their ip address, all that needs to be done is run this command again to update ip addresses.

Executes: [nginx-set-real-visitor-ip-from-cloudflare-enable.php](nginx-set-real-visitor-ip-from-cloudflare-enable.php)
```bash
curl -sS "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuanDMeGon/laravel-forge-recipes/master/nginx-set-real-visitor-ip-from-cloudflare-enable.php" | php
```

&nbsp;

#### Nginx - Set Real visitor ip address from Cloudflare (Disable)
Removes ```/etc/nginx/conf.d/cloudflare-set-real-ip.conf``` and restarts nginx

Executes: [nginx-set-real-visitor-ip-from-cloudflare-disable.sh](nginx-set-real-visitor-ip-from-cloudflare-disable.sh)
```bash
curl -sS "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuanDMeGon/laravel-forge-recipes/master/nginx-set-real-visitor-ip-from-cloudflare-disable.sh" | sh
```

&nbsp;

#### System - Install PHP Essentials
Will install packages mostly used by php apps and with some other custom packages

Executes: [system-install-php-essentials.sh](system-install-php-essentials.sh)
```bash
curl -sS "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuanDMeGon/laravel-forge-recipes/master/system-install-php-essentials.sh" | sh
```
